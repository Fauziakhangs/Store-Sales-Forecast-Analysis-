# Time-Series and Forecasting

**Time Series and Forecasting Store Sales**

This store sales dataset is taken from a grocery store in Ecuador spanning from 2013 to 2017. The primary goal was  to forecast future sales using time series analysis techniques. We explored the impact of promotions on sales and identified top-performing stores and product categories. This analysis is vital for stakeholders to make informed decisions regarding inventory management and promotional strategies.

. Initially, our team explored multiple datasets and visualized trends using bar charts, scatter plots, and QQ plots 📊. 

After switching to a more robust dataset, I led the modeling process using R 💻 with tools like ACF/PACF, KPSS/ADF tests, and Box plots to assess stationarity and white noise. I applied techniques like log transformations, differencing, and constructed both manual and auto ARIMA models 🔍. Residual analysis and backtesting helped refine model performance.

The forecasted plot of the harmonic regression with Arima  model highlights both the overall trend and the seasonal  fluctuations. This model with Fourier terms predicts the 
 seasonal patterns very well by capturing long-term upward  trends and regular fluctuations. However, this model can be  used for making future predictions for improved grocery



**Overview**

This project deepened my skills in forecasting, model diagnostics, and collaborative project management 🤝.  This project has significantly enriched my grasp and application of time series techniques and concepts. I've developed the ability to analyze and construct models for stationary data, employing various transformations and effectively implementing different ARIMA models..
