# Time-Series

**Time Series and Forecasting Store Sales**

This project focused on building an accurate time series forecasting 📈 model for retail store sales using the Store Sales Forecast Dataset 🛒. Initially, our team explored multiple datasets and visualized trends using bar charts, scatter plots, and QQ plots 📊. 

After switching to a more robust dataset, I led the modeling process using R 💻 with tools like ACF/PACF, KPSS/ADF tests, and Box plots to assess stationarity and white noise. I applied techniques like log transformations, differencing, and constructed both manual and auto ARIMA models 🔍. Residual analysis and backtesting helped refine model performance.
